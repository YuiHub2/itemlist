These are not hereditary castes but ones adopted in adulthood; heruan adolescents are expected to aspire to and train themselves for future inclusion into a caste.\n\nHeruan are sleek and nimble with powerful legs. They are swift on foot and their powerful talons can be dangerous in a fight, but their relative frailty makes them poor combatants overall.

However, they understand that sometimes the only way to preserve the memory of others is to defend oneself against those who would destroy them.",

But the Mincho was numb to psychic in the first place, so there was no progress in research.\n\nThe institute hypothesized that if parasites the variant mechanites - which makes up the body of the Mincho - a human body that has qualities of psychic, it can control the variant mechanites in the body through psychic, and as a result, it will can directly or indirectly control the Mincho. The Institute of psychic installed a psychic amplifier that includes variant mechanites in Marilyn's brain for enlighten psychic, and parasite variant mechanites.\n\nBut at the time, Marilyn's mind was devastated by the murder of her parents, and when a test-modified psychic amplifier was installed there, Marilyn went completely insane. At the same time, the psychic exploded, releasing the variant mechanites indiscriminately, and the researchers exposed to it became the Mincho when the body was reconstructed by the variant mechanites.\n\nMarilyn escaped from the Institute and disappeared for several years, and reappearing. Her mind was completely rebuilt by the modified psychic amplifier, and she believes that Mincho is what will lead her to salvation.

They are specifically coded to have moderately high psychic capabilities in order to allow them to passively read the surface emotions and intentions of those around them. However this level of genetic engineering renders them less physically capable and hardy than most other xenohumans. Meowstic is an advanced variation of xenohumans with a precisely tuned genome that becomes highly unstable outside of very short range of acceptable parameters. Technically they even can be considered an alien species. Their modification is impossible outside of advanced Glitterworld facilities and without source Genome templates.",

Future generations within the facilities were conditioned and raised as slaves and livestock.\n\n After a series of escapes and revolts on planet after planet, a coalition of freed Rakkle began colonies of their own, resisting capture and invasion to create a new world where Rakkle can live outside the yoke of slavery.

Of these, they have a particular affinity for the elusive truth behind shadow itself.\n\nChaoura have a marvelous utility organ that exploits phenomena manipulated by super-entities. This organ activates in darkness, bolstering its owner's abilities.\n\nMost attacks can't affect a chaoura under the cover of darkness. They can also evade perception and teleport through imaginary space when in darkness. In nighttime engagements, chaoura thus present an unprecedented threat. \n\nContact with hostile chaoura results in a phenomenon known as \"abyssal inflammation.\" This causes outbreaks of painful boils that each weaken the body separately. \n\nThe strengths of chaouran physiology don't come without costs, however. Any equipment with physical protection disrupts their ability to blend in with shadows. As such, they must rely on specialized weapons and apparel. Since the latter can't protect them, they're also vulnerable outside of darkness. \n\nDirect exposure to sunlight weakens chaoura by paralyzing their utility organs. As such, most chaoura exhibit sleep inversion.",

Long ago, the Critias drove artificia to the brink of extinction and destroyed their Creator. For this, they acquired the atrocious title of \"Decisive Autonomous Genocider Critias.\"\n\nLong ago, as the Creator's influence grew, adjacent spacer societies began to fear its technology. Using stolen Mysterion plans, they compiled the data of every existing race of artificia to produce the Critias. But their haphazard methods created erratic, uncontrollable beings. Intended as mere Creator deterrents, the Critias instead wreaked havoc across artifician space.\n\nUnited as one by the mighty qualeela, the artificia eventually stopped the Critias' holocaust. Yet the course of the clade's history was forever altered by the scars of war. The disaster affected each race in the clade in a different way. Some, like the nearmare, developed a deep-seated resentment of mechanical beings. Others, like the silkiera, became fascinated by the Critias' raw power.\n\nBut the most notable changes were in the qualeela. They grew obsessed with preventing the Critias from ever being reborn. Their leadership grew more tyrannical and suppressive as this obsession progressed. Even today, the influence of the disaster remains obvious in their domineering foreign policies.\n\nYet the Critias accounted for the possibility of their own destruction. During their travels throughout the stars, they left fragments of themselves behind. Into other mechanical beings they implanted their cells. They spread falsified information and hid pieces of their technology wherever they could. Indeed, there was no \"original race\" of idearn. The legends were mere fabrications intended to delude Entelechy and entice the ambitious.\n\nThe allure of power and wisdom will always draw people into mysteries. Knowing this, the Critias predicted that curiosity itself could become their salvation. And they were right.\n\n\"Repose at an end, the interstellar cleansing begins anew.\"\n\nIdearn must replace their Arche cartridges once per season.

This continues even against the orders of the Entelechian Royal Bloods.\n\nAs the Creator's final creation, their abilities surpass even those of qualeelan royalty. They have the power to singehandedly defeat an army and even defy death. Upon perishing, they shortly resurrect even stronger than they were before.\n\nLike their common kin, an Avonruach's body can nullify attacks. But in exchange for greater offensive performance, this ability is imperfect. It provides full protection against melee attacks, yet only partial protection for ranged attacks.\n\n\nThe Spirits of Iniquity did indeed destroy the Bird. But something was missing inside its corpse. \n\nOn that day, they knew that the seeds of the next calamity had already been sown...",

Unfortunately, their abilities proved too dangerous and uncontrollable for weaponization. Human societies instead trained most nearmare as covert operations \"intelligence specialists.\" This was a privileged position, guaranteeing abundant comforts and a high education. Thus, the nearmare had few qualms about working for humanity.\n\nEventually, internal conflict crumbled the societies that supported the nearmare. Survivors fled to smaller societies, using their psychic abilities to blend in. This, along with their unique reproduction cycles, allowed the nearmare to evade extinction.\n\nNearmare must carry psychic amplifier weapons to manifest their many psychic abilities. Among these is the power to summon ethereal entities to fight at their behest. They're also capable of voluntarily inflicting a variety of disruptive psychic ailments on their foes. However, a nearmare's physical capabilities are inferior to those of most other races. As such, they are at their strongest when cooperating with others.",

Thus, the Nearmare Aradia never recognized the authority of qualeelan royalty.\n\nWhen the Creator fell, the Nearmare Aradia began wielding their powers freely. In time, this gave rise to terrible calamities across various worlds. The three major artifician factions thus came together to prevent further disasters. They debated possible plans of action, even considering total extermination. But in the end, they decided on mercy, sealing away the Nearmare Aradia in special coffins.\n\nNearmare Aradia removed from their coffins tend to behave as reasonable, intellectual people. Excelling in research and medicine, they often become well-respected members of their societies. Yet none can grasp their true nature, nor understand what lies in their hearts. Moreover, their devilish beauty will threaten to tear their peers' relationships apart.\n\nNearmare Aradia are capable of a terrifying summoning act termed the \"Forbidden Summon.\" Be sure the vicinity is clear of friendly people and animals before using it.",

On some worlds, solark are thought capable of toppling buildings in a single strike.\n\nUnfortunately, solark must consume vast quantities of food to fuel their strong bodies. Moreover, their killer claws lack dexterity, reducing their capacity for skilled labor. This combined with their unique morphology also means they can't use weapons or tools of any kind. Lastly, solark regulate their furnaces based on ambient air temperature. As a result, sudden changes in temperature can be hazardous to them. Exposure to open flames in particular is to be avoided at all costs.",
